Step 1: Import the Project
Download and extract the Student.zip file.

Import the project into your preferred Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc.).

Step 2: Understand the Code & Database
Review the entire codebase carefully.

Ensure you have a good understanding of Java Swing and core Java programming.

Analyze how the database is structured (tables, relationships, queries).

Step 3: Navigate to VIP Section
Locate the vip.java file (or relevant package).

Understand its role in the system (likely admin/privileged functions).

Step 4: Set Up the Database
Check the database configuration in the code (likely MySQL or similar).

Create a database with the exact name specified in the code.

Ensure tables and schema match the project requirements.

Step 5: Add Required Libraries
SQL Connector JAR (e.g., mysql-connector-java-x.x.xx.jar).

jDateChooser JAR (for date picker functionality).

Download these JARs if missing (links may be provided in the project docs).

Add them to the project’s lib folder and configure the build path.

Step 6: Run the Main Interface
Open Student.java (or the main class).

Remove the comment on the main method (if it’s commented out).

Run the program to launch the GUI interface.

Additional Notes
If errors occur, verify:

Database credentials in the code.

Correct JAR files are linked.

All dependencies are resolved.
